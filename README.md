# Neverwinter Custom Content Compiler

NWCCC is package manager for Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition custom content, specifically art assets such as models or textures.

The code base is still very much a work in progress, but you can refer to the original [design proposal](doc/proposal.md) for the vision of what it strives to be.

Development is coordinated through the [NWNX:EE Discord](https://discord.gg/hxTt8Fr)
